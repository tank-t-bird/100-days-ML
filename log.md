# 100 Days Of ML Code

### Day 1: Friday, July 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 

Looked up some resources!
* Siraj's 3 month course: https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months
* Google's crash course: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework
* Unity's ML talk at Unite Berlin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a768FLX9bRc
* Machine Learning with Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxgnH8y2NM&index=1&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v

Listened to this while setting up the log file: 
* Siraj's new Hw to Use Github video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loav1kbA640&feature=youtu.be&t=3m53s

Watched the first 3 videos on linear algebra and was excited to learn about Geometric Intuition! Yes!! This is such a relief for my artist mind...

**Thoughts:** I was going to follow Siraj's CS course, but well, why not jump straight into ML, the main reason for doing that course? If I can't manage, I'll default back to that one. Loving the Linear Algebra videos, so lucky to get a joyful reeducation, THANKS INTERNET!!!
