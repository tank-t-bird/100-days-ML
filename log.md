# 100 Days Of ML Code

## Day 1: Friday, July 06, 2018 2h

**Today's Progress**: 

Looked up some resources!
* Siraj's 3 month course: https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months
* Google's crash course: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework
* Unity's ML talk at Unite Berlin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a768FLX9bRc
* Machine Learning with Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxgnH8y2NM&index=1&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v

Listened to this while setting up the log file: 
* Siraj's new Hw to Use Github video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loav1kbA640&feature=youtu.be&t=3m53s

Watched the first 3 videos on linear algebra and was excited to learn about Geometric Intuition! Yes!! This is such a relief for my artist mind...

**Thoughts:** 

I was going to follow Siraj's CS course, but well, why not jump straight into ML, the main reason for doing that course? If I can't manage, I'll default back to that one. Loving the Linear Algebra videos, so lucky to get a joyful reeducation, THANKS INTERNET!!!

## Day 2: Saturday, July 07, 2018 3h

**Today's Progress**: 

Watched video 4 (Chapter 3) on linear algebra from this playlist:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&index=1&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

Found this interesting math resource in the video comments:
* https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-008-calculus-revisited-complex-variables-differential-equations-and-linear-algebra-fall-2011/index.htm#

**Thoughts:** 

I modified some Processing code to visualize the vector grids transforming in space. But then I realized that the code needs to be taken much further to really match the way the grids fit in the Linear Algebra video.

## Day 3: Sunday, July 08, 2018 5h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed yesterdays'notes and watched videos 5-7 (Chapters 4 and 5) on linear algebra:

* [Three Dimensional Linear Transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHLEWRxRGiM&index=6&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [The Determinant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip3X9LOh2dk&index=7&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

I am amazed at how visualizing these trasnformations make the concepts so clear. Topics today, Matrix composition and determinants.

I also rediscovered this little treasure of a book, for all who have ever been afraid of Calculus: **"Calculus Made Easy" by Silvanus P. Thompson.**

This time for code, I've revisited [Catlike Coding's Rendering (matrices) example](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/part-1/), nothing added by me, just retyped the whole thing to make these concepts sink in, and did some minor style changes. So far I have Scaling and Position in.

**Thoughts:** 

Doing 1-3 hours daily feels more effective than crunching a bunch of hours and skipping a day. Not sure where the linear algebra will lead to in ML, but I am very excited to find out!! And also, learning theory and coding takes more like 3 hours than 2... not counting any issues like a simple .gitignore thing such as forgotetting a slash...

## Day 4: Monday, July 09, 2018 2.5h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed yesterdays'notes and watched videos 8 and 9 (Chapter 6) on linear algebra:
* [Inverse Matrices, Rank, Column Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw&index=8&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [Non-square Matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8VSDg_WQlA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=9)

I'm still working through [Catlike Coding's Rendering (matrices) example](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/part-1/), this time finishing the rotation script. Nothing added by me, just retyped the whole thing to make these concepts sink in, and did some minor style changes.

**Thoughts:** 

The Linear Algebra has allowed me to completely understand the Matrix tutorial. Halfway through it now. I do feel like the real challenge is coming up soon, as I try to keep all these bits and pieces clear in my mind. I'm aiming for a continuous 2 hours a day, one of theory,one of code.

## Day 5: Tuesday, July 10, 2018 3h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed yesterdays'notes and watched videos 10-12 (Chapters 7 + 8) on linear algebra:
* [Dot Products and Duality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0&index=10&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [Cross Products in the light of linear transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu6i7WJeinw&index=11&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [Cross products Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaM7OCEm3G0&t=106s)

Final part of [Catlike Coding's Rendering (matrices) example](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/part-1/), struggling a bit with homogeneus coordinates. Some naming and other minor style changes from the original.

**Thoughts:** 

My math muscles are getting stronger... my head hurts a bit. But finally understood camera projections and Matrix transformations... ah relief!


**Link to work:** Made with Unity3d 2018.1.5f1 [Day 005 Matrix Transformations (Unity3D/C#)](https://github.com/tank-t-bird/100-days-ML/blob/master/code/day005)

Try running it without the Camera Scripts in the Script GameObject and then again with the different camera scripts. We are reducing 3D to 2D with the Perspective and Orthographic Squish scripts. Also, it looks pretty. :-P

## Day 6: Wednesday, July 11, 2018 2.5h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed Cross Products and watched videos 13-15 (Chapters 9 - 11) on linear algebra:
* [Change of Basis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=13)
* [Eigen Vectors and Eigen Values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=14)
* [Abstract Vector Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKwz5Ikpc8&index=15&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

Found these gem in the comments:

**Thoughts:** 

That was enlightening... and now that the playlist is over I am a bit sad, I want to sart with teh ML stuff, but trying to pace myself, just one month of math... then 2 of ML!

Not done as it has an error still, but have to leave it for now. Also this is a very simple case, it probably doesn't work that well for all input values.

## Day 7: Thursday, July 12, 2018 3h

**Today's Progress**: 

* Practiced some math fundamentals on https://brilliant.org/

Got started with Calculus!
* [Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

Today's finds:

[8 Fun Machine Learning Projects for Beginners](https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-projects-for-beginners#gladiator)

And some great videos on Algebra: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra




**Thoughts:** 

It's important to move on and not get stuck on difficult bits. There is always a way around, or another perspective to work from, or, just taking a break can do wonders. Work smarter, not harder. "Be like water my friend". Too much of an effort that leads nowhere can be very demotivating.
