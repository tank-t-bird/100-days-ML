# 100 Days Of ML Code

## Day 1: Friday, July 06, 2018 2h

**Today's Progress**: 

Looked up some resources!
* Siraj's 3 month course: https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months
* Google's crash course: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework
* Unity's ML talk at Unite Berlin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a768FLX9bRc
* Machine Learning with Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxgnH8y2NM&index=1&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v

Listened to this while setting up the log file: 
* Siraj's new Hw to Use Github video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loav1kbA640&feature=youtu.be&t=3m53s

Watched the first 3 videos on linear algebra and was excited to learn about Geometric Intuition! Yes!! This is such a relief for my artist mind...
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&index=1&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

**Thoughts:** 

I was going to follow Siraj's CS course, but well, why not jump straight into ML, the main reason for doing that course? If I can't manage, I'll default back to that one. Loving the Linear Algebra videos, so lucky to get a joyful reeducation, THANKS INTERNET!!!

## Day 2: Saturday, July 07, 2018 3h

**Today's Progress**: 

Watched video 4 (Chapter 3) on linear algebra from this playlist:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&index=1&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

Found this interesting math resource in the video comments:
* https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-008-calculus-revisited-complex-variables-differential-equations-and-linear-algebra-fall-2011/index.htm#

**Thoughts:** 

I modified some Processing code to visualize the vector grids transforming in space. But then I realized that the code needs to be taken much further to really match the way the grids fit in the Linear Algebra video.

## Day 3: Sunday, July 08, 2018 5h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed yesterdays'notes and watched videos 5-7 (Chapters 4 and 5) on linear algebra:

* [Three Dimensional Linear Transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHLEWRxRGiM&index=6&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [The Determinant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip3X9LOh2dk&index=7&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

I am amazed at how visualizing these trasnformations make the concepts so clear. Topics today, Matrix composition and determinants.

I also rediscovered this little treasure of a book, for all who have ever been afraid of Calculus: **"Calculus Made Easy" by Silvanus P. Thompson.**

This time for code, I've revisited [Catlike Coding's Rendering (matrices) example](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/part-1/), nothing added by me, just retyped the whole thing to make these concepts sink in, and did some minor style changes. So far I have Scaling and Position in.

**Thoughts:** 

Doing 1-3 hours daily feels more effective than crunching a bunch of hours and skipping a day. Not sure where the linear algebra will lead to in ML, but I am very excited to find out!! And also, learning theory and coding takes more like 3 hours than 2... not counting any issues like a simple .gitignore thing such as forgotetting a slash...

## Day 4: Monday, July 09, 2018 2.5h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed yesterdays'notes and watched videos 8 and 9 (Chapter 6) on linear algebra:
* [Inverse Matrices, Rank, Column Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw&index=8&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [Non-square Matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8VSDg_WQlA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=9)

I'm still working through [Catlike Coding's Rendering (matrices) example](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/part-1/), this time finishing the rotation script. Nothing added by me, just retyped the whole thing to make these concepts sink in, and did some minor style changes.

**Thoughts:** 

The Linear Algebra has allowed me to completely understand the Matrix tutorial. Halfway through it now. I do feel like the real challenge is coming up soon, as I try to keep all these bits and pieces clear in my mind. I'm aiming for a continuous 2 hours a day, one of theory,one of code.

## Day 5: Tuesday, July 10, 2018 3h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed yesterdays'notes and watched videos 10-12 (Chapters 7 + 8) on linear algebra:
* [Dot Products and Duality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0&index=10&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [Cross Products in the light of linear transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu6i7WJeinw&index=11&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [Cross products Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaM7OCEm3G0&t=106s)

Final part of [Catlike Coding's Rendering (matrices) example](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/part-1/), struggling a bit with homogeneus coordinates. Some naming and other minor style changes from the original.

**Thoughts:** 

My math muscles are getting stronger... my head hurts a bit. But finally understood camera projections and Matrix transformations... ah relief!

Try running it without the Camera Scripts in the Script GameObject and then again with the different camera scripts. We are reducing 3D to 2D with the Perspective and Orthographic Squish scripts. Also, it looks pretty. :-P

## Day 6: Wednesday, July 11, 2018 2.5h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed Cross Products and watched videos 13-15 (Chapters 9 - 11) on linear algebra:
* [Change of Basis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=13)
* [Eigen Vectors and Eigen Values](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=14)
* [Abstract Vector Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgKwz5Ikpc8&index=15&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

Found these gem in the comments:

Reference to  Davyd C. Lay's Linear Algebra and Its Applications along with these exercises: http://www.slader.com/textbook/9780321385178-linear-algebra-and-its-applications-4th-edition/


**Thoughts:** 

That was enlightening... and now that the playlist is over I am a bit sad, I want to sart with teh ML stuff, but trying to pace myself, just one month of math... then 2 of ML!

Not done as it has an error still, but have to leave it for now. Also this is a very simple case, it probably doesn't work that well for all input values.

## Day 7: Thursday, July 12, 2018 3h

**Today's Progress**: 

* Practiced some math fundamentals on https://brilliant.org/

Got started with Calculus!
* [Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

Today's finds:

[8 Fun Machine Learning Projects for Beginners](https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-projects-for-beginners#gladiator)

And some great videos on Algebra: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra

**Thoughts:** 

It's important to move on and not get stuck on difficult bits. There is always a way around, or another perspective to work from, or, just taking a break can do wonders. Work smarter, not harder. "Be like water my friend". Too much of an effort that leads nowhere can be very demotivating.

**Link to work:**  No code today, just Math.

## Day 8: Friday, July 13, 2018 1h

**Today's Progress**: 

Began watching the Calculus videos, derivatives, derivatives, derivatives. Watched the first 3.5 videos:
* [The Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG15m2VwSjA&index=4&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)


**Thoughts:** 

I only had one hour today, after work, and it was much tougher to follow along than when I do these in the morning.

**Link to work:**  None today.

## Day 9: Saturday, July 14, 2018 2h

**Today's Progress**: 

I reviewed the Linear Algebra videos and the first Calculus videos. Ended at Chapter 2 of the series. I had to split the work into two separate hours today and that was ok, but I do prefer the 2-3 hour chunks of uninterrupted learning.

* [The Paradox of the Derivative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&index=2&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)


**Thoughts:** 

Repetition is paramount. Each time a rewatch a video, I not only strengthen the learnings that have stayed with me, but I also find new meanings or perspectives on some aspects which I did not perceive the first time around.

**Link to work:**  None today.

## Day 10: Sunday, July 15, 2018 2h

**Today's Progress**: 

Watching chapter 2 again, I found some shaky foundations to work on, did a bunch of exercises to stabilize them and then watched Chapter 3. I also rediscovered what was a math nightmare in my teens, the infamous "Algebra of Baldor". Much more readable all these years later...

* [The Paradox of the Derivative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&index=2&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
* [Derivative formulas through geometry | Chapter 3, Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_qX4VJhMQ&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=3)
* [Algebra basics on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/introduction-to-algebra/overview-hist-alg/v/abstract-ness)


**Thoughts:** 

Finding weaknesses in foundations can be discouraging, because it slows down progress forward, but if we don't fix them now... then when? Comprehension of more complex concepts will be muddled by these deficiencies. To motivate myself, two quotes from the Khan Academy videos:

"Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our eyes-- I mean the universe-- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. This book is written in the mathematical language, without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth."

-Galileo Galilei


"You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing.” 

-Rene Descartes

## Day 11: Monday, July 16, 2018 2h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed chapters 3-4 and watched chapters 5-6 of the Calculus playlist.

* [Derivative formulas through geometry | Chapter 3, Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_qX4VJhMQ&index=3&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
* [Visualizing the chain rule and product rule | Chapter 4, Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG15m2VwSjA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=4)
* [Derivatives of exponentials | Chapter 5, Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2MIpDrF7Es&index=5&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

**Thoughts:** 

Getting tired of the math, but this feesl like the key to everything realted to ML, rates of change and interdependent values changing in time. So, I will keep on keeping on. 

**Link to work:**  None today.

## Day 12: Tuesday, July 17, 2018 2h

**Today's Progress**: 

I received some new ML links from a colleague which look really interesting. I read through some of the documentation for the first one and tried the online samples (ML5).

* [ML5](https://ml5js.org/)
* [Machine Learning for Artists](https://github.com/ml4a/ml4a-guides/tree/experimental/tools)
* [Artists and Machine Intelligence](https://ami.withgoogle.com/)

And I reviewed chapter 6 and watched chapters 7-8 of the Calculus playlist. 

* [Implicit differentiation, what's going on here? | Chapter 6, Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb40J4N1fa4&index=6&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
* [Limits | Chapter 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfF40MiS7zA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=7)
* [Integration and the fundamental theorem of calculus | Chapter 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfG8ce4nNh0&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=8)

Also, 3b1b has an open source repository for their Math Animations built in python, which I hope to play with at some point:
* [3b1b Manim Animation Engine](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)

**Thoughts:** 

Even though I might not be using the math much, I am loving it, it is giving me the confidence to go beyond reusing existing models. but there is much to try out with the existing ones!

A quote to think about: "One should never try to prove anything that is not almost obvious" - Alexander Grothendieck (clearly this refers to math proofs, but stilll...).

**Link to work:**  None today.

## Day 13: Wednesday, July 18, 2018 45m

**Today's Progress**: 

Less time for this today because I am working on a presentation for tomorrow about VR, but still managed to watch 2.5 videos...

* [What does area have to do with slope? | Chapter 9, Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnJqaIESC2s&index=9&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
* [Higher order derivatives | Footnote, Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkz5LGWihw&index=10&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)

**Thoughts:** 

A little bit of progress is better than none. 

**Link to work:**  None today.

## Days 14-15: Friday-Saturday, July 20-21, 2018 2h (skipped Thursday)

**Today's Progress**: 

Had to skip Thursday's learning due to the event, but finished the Calculus series yesterday and started on Probability today, Lecture 1. Also, the MIT course linked to is not open yet, so I was lucky to find the contents of the course at the link below.

* [Part I: The Fundamentals, Lecture 1: Probability Models and Axioms and Lecture 1 Supplement: Mathematical Background ](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-012-introduction-to-probability-spring-2018/part-i-the-fundamentals/)
* [When does a sequence converge?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=Lgacew5BjDI)

**Thoughts:** 

Restarting is harder than keeping the ball rolling... I am really appreciating the order of Siraj's topic selections, everything builds upon the previous section. It will be hard to do the whole MIT probability course in one week, but I'll be happy with doing all of part 1, the Fundamentals.

**Link to work:**  None today.

## Day 16 Sunday, July 22, 2018 2.5h 

**Today's Progress**: 

Struggling to balance life and study, but ysterday I managed to finish Lecture 2. Also, I found the youtube playlist link, so I can now watch at fast speed.

* [MIT RES.6-012 Introduction to Probability, Spring 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60hI9ATjSFgLZpbNJ7myAg6)

1. L01: Probability Models and Axioms + Supplement (Mathematical Background)
2. L02: Conditioning and Bayes Rule


**Thoughts:** 

The main difficulty has been holding the new symbols in my mind while following the concepts. Nevertheless it all makes a lot of sense. 

**Link to work:**  None today.

## Day 17 Monday, July 23, 2018 2h 

**Today's Progress**: 

Got up earlier so that I can work on other projects... 

* [MIT RES.6-012 Introduction to Probability, Spring 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60hI9ATjSFgLZpbNJ7myAg6)

1. L03 1-10 Independence
2. L04 1-3 Counting


**Thoughts:** 

I am realizing that I used to shy away from the kind of thinking that probability theorems resolve because I didn't know the tools... now it feels great to learn them and see thier application.

**Link to work:**  None today.
