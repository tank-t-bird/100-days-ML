# 100 Days Of ML Code

## Day 1: Friday, July 06, 2018 2h

**Today's Progress**: 

Looked up some resources!
* Siraj's 3 month course: https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months
* Google's crash course: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework
* Unity's ML talk at Unite Berlin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a768FLX9bRc
* Machine Learning with Python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxgnH8y2NM&index=1&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v

Listened to this while setting up the log file: 
* Siraj's new Hw to Use Github video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loav1kbA640&feature=youtu.be&t=3m53s

Watched the first 3 videos on linear algebra and was excited to learn about Geometric Intuition! Yes!! This is such a relief for my artist mind...
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&index=1&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

**Thoughts:** I was going to follow Siraj's CS course, but well, why not jump straight into ML, the main reason for doing that course? If I can't manage, I'll default back to that one. Loving the Linear Algebra videos, so lucky to get a joyful reeducation, THANKS INTERNET!!!

## Day 2: Saturday, July 07, 2018 3h

**Today's Progress**: 

Watched video 4 (Chapter 3) on linear algebra from this playlist:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&index=1&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab

Found this interesting math resource in the video comments:
* https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-008-calculus-revisited-complex-variables-differential-equations-and-linear-algebra-fall-2011/index.htm#

**Thoughts:** 
I modified some Processing code to visualize the vector grids transforming in space. But then I realized that the code needs to be taken much further to really match the way the grids fit in the Linear Algebra video.

## Day 3: Sunday, July 08, 2018 5h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed yesterdays'notes and watched videos 5-7 (Chapters 4 and 5) on linear algebra:

* [Three Dimensional Linear Transformations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHLEWRxRGiM&index=6&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [The Determinant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip3X9LOh2dk&index=7&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

I am amazed at how visualizing these trasnformations make the concepts so clear. Topics today, Matrix composition and determinants.

I also rediscovered this little treasure of a book, for all who have ever been afraid of Calculus: **"Calculus Made Easy" by Silvanus P. Thompson.**

This time for code, I've revisited [Catlike Coding's Rendering (matrices) example](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/part-1/), nothing added by me, just retyped the whole thing to make these concepts sink in, and did some minor style changes. So far I have Scaling and Position in.

**Thoughts:** 
Doing 1-3 hours daily feels more effective than crunching a bunch of hours and skipping a day. Not sure where the linear algebra will lead to in ML, but I am very excited to find out!! And also, learning theory and coding takes more like 3 hours than 2... not counting any issues like a simple .gitignore thing such as forgotetting a slash...

## Day 4: Monday, July 09, 2018 h

**Today's Progress**: 

Reviewed yesterdays'notes and watched videos 8 and 9 (Chapter 6) on linear algebra:
* [Inverse Matrices, Rank, Column Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw&index=8&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* [Non-square Matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8VSDg_WQlA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=9)

I'm still working thorugh [Catlike Coding's Rendering (matrices) example](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/part-1/), this time finishing the rotation script. Nothing added by me, just retyped the whole thing to make these concepts sink in, and did some minor style changes.

**Thoughts:** 
The Linear Algebra has made me completely understand the Matrix tutorial. Halfway through it now. I do feel like the real challenge is coming up soon, as I try to keep all these bits and pieces clear in my mind. I'm aiming for a continuos 2 hours a day, one of theory,one of code.
